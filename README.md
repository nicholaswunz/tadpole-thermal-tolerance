## Abstract
**Aim**: Global warming and deforestation are pushing species closer to their physiological limit, especially for species with habitat-restricted life stages because sunlit areas have higher maximal temperatures. Here, we examined the upper critical thermal limit (CT<sub>max</sub>), and maximum environmental water temperature (T<sub>max</sub>) of larvae from 29 anuran species across a latitudinal gradient (22–43° N) to test how latitude and habitat type (open or closed-forest ponds) affected warming tolerance, an index of vulnerability to climate change.  
**Location**: Taiwan, Korea, Japan.  
**Time period**: Present.  
**Major taxa studied**: Anurans.  
**Results**: We showed that open ponds lowered warming tolerance, regardless of latitude and phylogenetic clustering, contrasting the established literature that warming tolerance is lower at tropical latitudes, which only applied to species in forest ponds in this study. Importantly, biophysical models at the local scale suggest that increasing deforestation will exacerbate the effects of climate warming on warming tolerance.  
**Main conclusions**: Local effects of accelerated warming and habitat modification means that species with range-restricted life stages will be subjected to increased vulnerability to anthropogenic change.
