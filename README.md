## Abstract
Climate change and deforestation have accelerated global warming over the last century, pushing species closer to their physiological limit. Species tolerance to warming depends on the difference between their upper thermal limit and the maximum environmental temperature experienced. Open habitats can reduce warming tolerance for species with range-restricted life stages because sunlit areas have higher maximal temperatures and are less thermally heterogeneous. We examined the upper critical thermal limit (CT<sub>max</sub>), and maximum environmental water temperature (T<sub>max</sub>) of larvae from 29 amphibian species across three countries from different geographical zones to test how latitude and habitat type (open or closed-forest) affected warming tolerance. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we showed Tmax strongly correlated with warming tolerance, while CT<sub>max</sub> did not predict warming tolerance. Therefore, the maximal environmental temperature provides an accurate estimate of an animal’s warming tolerance. Importantly, we show species that breed in open habitats have lower warming tolerance, regardless of latitude, and biophysical models indicate deforestation will exacerbate the effects of climate warming on amphibian warming tolerance. Our data reveal a potentially serious emerging problem: accelerated warming and deforestation means range restricted animal’s will be subjected closer to their physiological limit and hence increased vulnerability to anthropogenic change.
