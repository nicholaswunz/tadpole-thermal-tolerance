## Abstract
**Aim**: Global warming and deforestation are pushing species closer to their physiological limit, especially for species with habitat-restricted life stages because sunlit areas have higher maximal temperatures. Here, we examined the upper critical thermal limit (CTmax), and maximum environmental water temperature (Tmax) of larvae from 29 anuran species across three latitudinally independent countries to test how latitude and habitat type (open or closed-forest) affected warming tolerance, an index on the difference between the species upper thermal limit and the maximum environmental temperature experienced.  
**Location**: Taiwan, Korea, Japan.  
**Time period**: Present.  
**Major taxa studied**: Anuran.  
**Results**: We showed that open habitats lowered warming tolerance, regardless of latitude and phylogenetic clustering, contrasting the established literature that warming tolerance is lower at tropical latitudes, which only applied to species in forest habitats in this study. Importantly, biophysical models suggest that increasing deforestation will exacerbate the effects of climate warming on warming tolerance.  
**Main conclusions**: Our data reveal a potentially serious ecological problem: accelerated warming and deforestation means that species with range restricted life stages globally will be subjected closer to increased vulnerability to anthropogenic change.  

**Keywords:** amphibian decline, critical thermal maximum, latitudinal variation, macrophysiology, microhabitat, thermal tolerance, warming tolerance
